<h3 allign="center"> <b> Abstract </b></h3>

In recent years efforts towards combating pollution have risen yet not enough is being done to combat these issues on a more local level. Low-income communities often have the fear of environmental gentrification when clean-up efforts are made and often are forced to remain in polluted areas. Aquatic pollution and environmental gentrification need to be addressed further. In this project, the goals were to design and construct a device that is able to produce a substantial amount of electricity (~20V or more) and efficiently filter water. The device showed improvement in infiltration test factors (total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and pH). Currently, only the filtration aspect has been tested and further testing and modification are in motion to better filtration and test electricity production.
